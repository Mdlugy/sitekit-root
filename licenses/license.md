# SiteKit Personal Commercial Use License v1

This license governs the use of the SiteKit framework and all official modules, components, and themes distributed by the original author (Matthew Dlugy).

---

## ‚úÖ You MAY:

- Use SiteKit and any included modules in **personal or commercial projects**
- Modify and adapt SiteKit code for your own use
- Deploy your work built with SiteKit publicly or commercially
- **Claim full ownership** of anything you create using SiteKit
- Use both free and paid modules without attribution

---

## ‚ùå You MAY NOT:

- Sell, sublicense, or redistribute SiteKit modules or components as standalone products
- Include SiteKit modules in other open-source or commercial frameworks
- Publish any SiteKit module source code (modified or unmodified) in a public repository or registry
- Bundle SiteKit with SaaS tools, builders, or template platforms

---

## üõí Exception: Selling Third-Party Modules

You **may develop and sell** your own SiteKit-compatible modules, layouts, or themes ‚Äî even if they rely on or import proprietary SiteKit components (e.g. from the `components/` folder) ‚Äî provided that:

- Your product is **not bundled with SiteKit itself**
- You do **not repackage** official SiteKit modules
- Your customers are expected to have their own licensed copy of SiteKit

This enables a third-party module marketplace without allowing redistribution of core assets.

---

## üåê Deployment Restriction

Each SiteKit license permits deployment to **one publicly accessible website**.

- A "deployment" is defined as a unique domain or subdomain running SiteKit-based code.
- You may not use a single license across multiple distinct websites or production environments.
- For each additional deployment, a new license must be obtained.

For agencies, multi-site deployments, or white-label use, contact: **[your contact info]**
