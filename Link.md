"I thrive where tech and communication meet.

My journey started in NYC street sales, where I learned how to earn a stranger‚Äôs trust in 30 seconds flat. That grit carried me into B2B SaaS sales roles at LEAP Legal and RealCar, and eventually into full-stack engineering after putting myself through a coding bootcamp.

Over the past two years, I‚Äôve built scrapers, API integrations, and data pipelines for complex insurance platforms‚Äîoften working solo and solving ambiguous technical challenges with little documentation or support. I‚Äôm especially strong at bridging gaps between engineering and users, turning messy workflows into elegant, reliable systems.

Today, I‚Äôm focused on hybrid roles like Sales Engineering, Solutions Consulting, and Technical Account Management‚Äîroles where I can translate complex requirements into actionable solutions, support high-stakes client conversations, and deliver measurable business impact.

Let‚Äôs connect if you‚Äôre building something that could benefit from a technical generalist who knows how to sell."
